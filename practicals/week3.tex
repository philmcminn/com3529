\title{Week 3 Practical --- Coverage Part 2}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Do the ``Who Wants To Be A Software Tester?'' Quiz for this week.
    If you're unclear about any of the answers then ask!

    \item Navigate to the \examplespackage~package, and open the
    \spacedefenderclass class. 

        \begin{enumerate}

            \item Draw the CCFG for this class.
            
            \item Annotate each node $n$ of the CCFG with $\mathit{defs}(n)$ and 
            $\mathit{uses}(n)$.

            \item Write out the set $\mathit{DU}$. In particular, identify any
            elements of $\mathit{DU}$ that are infeasible.
            
            \item Identify which elements of $\mathit{DU}$ are applicable to 
            
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item All Defs Coverage
                \item All Uses Coverage
                \item All Def-Use Paths Coverage
            \end{enumerate}            
            
        \end{enumerate}

    \item Review the partitions discussed for \triangleclass in the lecture.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Make any improvements or changes to the partitions as you see fit.
        
        \item Identify any constraints (``cannot be combined'' and ``must be combined'')
        
        \item Identify the base choices for each partition and the test
        requirements generated by a Base Choice Coverage strategy.

        \item Devise and write JUnit test cases for each test requirement. Is
        there anything strange that you notice about the \triangleclass?
    \end{enumerate}
        

\end{enumerate}
