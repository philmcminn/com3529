\title{Week 2 Practical}{Coverage Part 1}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Do the ``Who Wants To Be A Software Tester?'' Quiz for this week.
    If you're unclear about any of the answers then ask!

    \item Navigate to the \lecturespackage~package, and open the
    \triangleclass class. The class has a method, \classifymethod, that
    categorises the type of the triangle based on the lengths of its three sides,
    which correspond to the parameters to the method --- {\tt side1}, {\tt
    side2}, and {\tt side3}. The {\it equilateral} triangle is one in which all sides
    are the same length, an isosceles triangle is one in which at least two
    sides are the same length, a scalene triangle is any other (valid) triangle. 

        \begin{enumerate}

            \item Draw the CFG for the \classifymethod~method.
            
            \item Write a JUnit test suite for \triangleclass that gives 
            full Branch Coverage. 
            
            \item Enumerate all the paths through the CFG for the method. (There
            are no loops in the method, so this is possible.) Which paths are
            infeasible?
