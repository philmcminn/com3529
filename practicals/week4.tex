\title{Week 4 Practical Session}{Coverage Part 3}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Do the ``Who Wants To Be A Software Tester?'' Quiz for this week.
    If you're unclear about any of the answers then ask!

    \item Review the partitions discussed for \triangleclass in the lecture.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Make any improvements or changes to the partitions as you see fit.
        
        \item Identify any constraints (``cannot be combined'' and ``must be combined'')
        
        \item Identify the base choices for each partition and the test
        requirements generated by a Base Choice Coverage strategy.

        \item Devise and write JUnit test cases for each test requirement. Is
        there anything strange that you notice about the \triangleclass~class?
