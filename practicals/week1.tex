\title{Week 1 Practical --- Fundamentals of Software Testing}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Do the ``Who Wants To Be A Software Tester?'' Quiz for this week.
    If you're unclear about any of the answers then ask!

    \item Clone the examples repository (\examplesrepourl) for the module, and
    set things up on your own machine (or on Codio) following the instructions
    in the {\tt README.md} file.

    \item Navigate to the \examplespackage~package, and open the \weekonepracticalclass
    class. The class contains four methods. For each method:

        \begin{enumerate}

            \item Identify the fault.
            
            \item If possible, write a JUnit test case that does {\it not} execute the fault.
            
            \item If possible, write a JUnit test case that executes the fault, but
            does not infect the program state.

            \item If possible, write a JUnit test case that causes an infection,
            but {\it not} a failure.

            \item For the given test case, identify the first infected
            (i.e., erroneous) program state. Be sure to describe the complete
            state.
            
            \item Fix the fault and verify that the given test now produces the
            expected output.
