\begin{enumerate}

    \item Review the partitions discussed for \triangleclass in the lecture.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Make any improvements or changes to the partitions as you see fit.
        
        \item Identify any constraints (``cannot be combined'' and ``must be combined'')
        
        \item Identify the base choices for each partition and the test
        requirements generated by a Base Choice Coverage strategy.

        \item Devise and write JUnit test cases for each test requirement. Is
        there anything strange that you notice about the \triangleclass~class?
