[TODO: ADD SOME CODE!]

(a) Identify the fault [1]

(b) Give an example of an input that:

(i) Does not execute the fault [1]
(ii) Executes the fault, but does not infect the program state [1]
(iii) Causes an infection, but not a failure [1]
(iv) Causes the program to fail [1]

(c) Write the fixed version of the code [1]

Total [6]

(d) An infeasible path [1]
(e) A definition [1]
(f) A use [1]
(g) A ``killing'' definition [1]
(h) A definition-use pair [1]

Total [11]
