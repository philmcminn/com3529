- Better software testing means revealing more faults/failures, if there are
  any [1 mark]

- In general, we cannot say which of these two scenarios would be better [1 mark]

- In practice it would depends on the program, test cases, and faults in it [1 mark]
  even though we know that branch coverage subsumes statement coverage [1 mark]
  that is, all test suites that obtain 100% branch coverage they will also obtain
  100% statement coverage [1 mark].

- This can be explained in terms of the RIP model [1 mark]. 

- Just executing part of program does not mean the state of the program is
  infected and that those infections go on to propagate to a failure [1 mark]
