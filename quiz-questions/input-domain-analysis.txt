Q) The following is a partition of a floating point variable f:

e1: f < 1
e2: f = 0
e3: f > 1

Which of the following is FALSE?

a) There are three equivalence classes
b) The partition is disjoint
c) The partition is complete
X it's not complete, what about f -1..0 and 0..1, f is a floating point
d) The partition is based on one characteristic of f
