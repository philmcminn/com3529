Welcome to "who wants to be a software tester?"

The quiz show where if you want to be the best, you need to know how to test.

This is purely for a bit of fun ... It's not marked

We'll go through the answers in the lab session.

A series of multiple choice questions. 

All the lifelines you want, 

you can phone a friend
ask everyone on the course

we can't do 50:50, 
that's kind of difficult to
pull off in an non-interactive video....
