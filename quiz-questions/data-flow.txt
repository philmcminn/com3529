Q) Given the following program

Node no. 
1) public int aMethod(int y) {
2)     x = 0;
3)     if (y > 0) {
4)         x ++;
5)     }
6)     System.out.println(x);
7)     return x;
8) }

Which of the following statements are true?

1) Node 1 is a use
2) Node 4 is a use
3) The path 2->3->5->6 is definition-clear with respect to x
4) 1->2->3 is a definition-use path

a) all of them
* b) 2, 3, and 4 only
c) 2 and 4 only 
d) 1 and 3 only

Q) Given the same program, which of the following statements are false?

1) Node 4 kills the definition of x assigned at node 2 T
2) Node 3 kills the definition of y assigned at node 1 F
3) defs(4) = uses(4) T
4) defs(4) = uses(6) T

a) all of them
b) 1 and 4 only
* c) 2 only
d) 1, 3 and 4 only


Q) Which of the following statements is the odd one out?

a) A CCFG has a special node "c"
* b) The set DU is the set of all definitions and uses in a program
(it's false, the others are true)
c) In All-Uses Coverage, each definition reaches each use
d) Definitions are where values are created

Q) Given the following program

 1) public void anotherMethod(int a) {
 2)     int r = a + 1;
 3)     int s = a - 1;
 4)     if (a == 0) {
 5)         r = 2;
 6)     } else if (a == 1) {
 7)         s = r;
 8)     }
 9)     return r * s;
10) }

And the paths
1) 2->3->4->6->7->8->9 
2) 2->3->4->5
3) 3->4->5->8->9
4) 3->4->8->9

Which of the following is the odd one out?

a) All Defs coverage includes one of paths 1 and 2 but not both
b) All Uses coverage includes both paths 1 and 2
* c) All Uses coverage includes both paths 3 and 4
(it's false, the others are true)
d) All Def-Use Paths coverage includes both paths 1 and 2

Q) Which of the following is FALSE?

a) All Def-Use Paths subsumes All-Uses
* b) All Def-Use Paths subsumes Path Coverage
c) All Def-Use Paths subsumes All-Defs
d) All-Uses subsumes All-Defs
