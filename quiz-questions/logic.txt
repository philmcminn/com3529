Q) How many conditions are there in the following predicate?

(a > b) && (c != d || e > f) && (!g)

A. 3
B. 2
C. 1
D. * 4

Q) Which criterion would result in the most test requirements for 
the predicate?

(a > b) && (c != d || e > f) && (!g)

A. * Multiple Condition
B. MCDC
C. Branch
D. Condition Decision

Q) Which of the following statements is TRUE?

branch predicate
