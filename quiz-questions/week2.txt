A. 1 and 4 only
B. 2 only
C. * 1, 3, and 4 only
D. 1 only

2) Which of the following statements are FALSE?

1. Covering all the paths in a program is not sensible when there are unbounded
loops
2. Branches comprise of all the edges in a CFG
3. The nodes of a CFG correspond to individual program statements
4. A test suite that covers all the branches of a program will also cover all of
its statements

A. 2 and 3 only
B. 1 and 4 only
C. 2 only
D. 1 only

3) Which of the following statements are TRUE?

1. If we have 100% coverage of a program, we will find all the bugs in it.
2. A coverage criterion A subsumes B if by achieving full coverage of A, we have
achieved full coverage of B
3. Black-box coverage criteria examine the internal structure of a piece of
software to devise test requirements
4. A test requirement is the same as a test case

A. All of them
B. 1, 3 and 4 only
C. 2 only
D. 4 only

4) Which of the following statements are TRUE?

1. 50% Statement Coverage represents higher program coverage than 25% Branch
Coverage
2. Coverage Level is the percentage of the number of test requirements of the
coverage criterion that the test suite fulfils
3. An infeasible test requirement is when there is no test case that could be
written to fufil the test requirement
4. Coverage Level is the percentage of bugs a test suite finds in a program

A. 1, 2 and 3 only
B. 1, 2 and 4 only
C. 2 and 4 only
D. 2 and 3 only

5. Take the following program. CFG node labels appear in comments like this: /* A */

public int fib(int count) {
    int num1 = 0;
    int num2 = 1;

    for (int i = 1 /* A */; i <= count /* B */ ; ++i /* X */)
    {
        int sumOfPrevTwo = num1 + num2; /* C */
        num1 = num2;
        num2 = sumOfPrevTwo;
    }
    
    return num2; /* D */ 
}

Where does the edge from node X go to?

A, B, C, or D?

6. How many conditions are there in the following predicate?

(a > b) && (c != d || e > f) && (!g)

A. 3
B. 2
C. 1
D. * 4

7. Which criterion would result in the most test requirements for 
the predicate?

(a > b) && (c != d || e > f) && (!g)

A. * Multiple Condition
B. MCDC
C. Branch
D. Condition Decision

8. Which of the following statements is TRUE?

1. Condition Decision Coverage subsumes Branch Coverage
2. Condition Decision Coverage subsumes Condition Coverage
3. With Correlated MCDC, the truth values of the minor conditions are fixed
4. With MCDC, the truth value of the major condition flips with the
branch predicate

A. * 1, 2 and 4 only
B. 1, 2 and 3 only
C. 2, 3 and 4 only
D. All of them

9. The following represents two test requirements for Correlated MCDC. Which
condition(s) qualify as the major condition?

T F T F F
F F F T T

A. 1 and 3 only
B. 2 only
C. 1, 3 and 4 only
D. None of them

10. The following represents two test requirements for Restricted MCDC. Which
condition(s) qualify as the major condition?

1 2 3 4 B
T F T F F
F F T F T

A. 1 only
B. 1 and 3 only
C. 2 and 4 only
D. None of them
