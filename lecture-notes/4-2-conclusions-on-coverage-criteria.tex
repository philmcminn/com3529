\title{Coverage Criteria}{4.2 Interim Conclusions on Coverage Criteria}

\section{Introduction}

We're at the end of this block of the course on coverage, and we've encountered
a number of criteria already! 

We're now going take a look at some of the pros and cons of coverage criteria.

\section{Industry and Coverage Criteria}

It's fair to say that there's a lot of scepticism about coverage criteria from some
quarters of industry. Some of this is down to the belief that coverage means
code coverage only. Even in the software industry though, most people agree that
code coverage is a useful metric.

The view changes somewhat for high integrity or safety critical systems where
coverage criteria are very important, so much so that they form the basis of
many software standards, as we saw with MCDC.

\section{Pros and Cons of Coverage}

Some common criticisms of coverage criteria can be summarised as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bf They can generate too many test requirements.} Sometimes there
    are more test requirements than are simply economically viable to test for.
    The number of test requirements generated can become quickly overwhelming,
    particularly when testers do not break a system down into subcomponents
    and/or priortise testing on the riskiest or most safety critical aspects of 
    a system.
    
    \item {\bf Not all the test requirements are useful.} This does not mean
    that {\it none} of the test requirements are useful, but sometimes industry
    managers write off systematic processes when they can not see the value in
    every single test case.

    \item {\bf Higher coverage does not necessarily guarantee that more bugs will be
    found.} While higher coverage tends to mean that more faults will be discovered,
    this is not always guaranteed. Merely executing a fault does not mean it will
    infect the state, and propagate to the output as a failure. 
    But in general, more testing does not necessarily mean more bugs will be found
    --- the law of diminishing returns is at play here as well --- this is a general
    issue for software testers. 
\end{enumerate}

These ``cons'' are all true. But there are several pros as well, let's go back to
some of the original motivations for coverage criteria and re-evaluate them in
the light of what we've learnt:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item {\bf Coverage Criteria ensure our test suite has certain sets of 
    properties.}
       
    Professional testers are often following testing strategies similar to those
    provided by coverage criteria when designing tests, although they may not
    realise it. In particular, good testers excel at thinking about rare
    situations, putting together combinations of events, or attempting
    ``what-if'' scenarios that are not too dissimilar to the steps performed as
    part of Input Domain Analysis.
    
    Coverage Criteria help formalise the process for creating tests, on the
    basis of test requirements. Although we've discussed them at a mostly
    informal level, we could write them out as algorithms, if we wanted.
    This systematic derivation is useful, because as well as telling us about
    what's covered --- i.e., what we {\it did} --- we also know what's {\it not}
    covered, i.e., what we {\it didn't do}. Perhaps more usefully, compared to a
    human-driven process, they can tell us what we {\it forgot}. It's hard to
    always remember things without a system for reminding you!

    \item {\bf Coverage Criteria tell us how much testing has been done, 
    and provide an indication as to when to stop testing.}
    
    Coverage Levels provide a useful metric as to how much testing we've done.
    Although it says nothing about the number of bugs we've not found, most
    coverage criteria provide confidence that the more testing you've done, the
    less {\it likely} it is that unfound serious bugs remain. Coverage Levels
    give developers, testers, and software managers concrete metrics to talk
    about. We can decide that ``enough'' of the software has been tested once we
    reach a certain coverage level.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Software Testing Research and Coverage Criteria}

Coverage Criteria continue to be important to Software Testing research and
researchers (of which Rob and I are just two!).

As we've seen Software Testing involves many difficult problems, and Coverage
Criteria play into some of the insights behind some of those issues. One day,
the metrics that coverage criteria provide may be able to inform practical
testing about useful things like:

\begin{itemize}

    \item The relationship between actual faults, failures and types of coverage
    and coverage levels.

    \item Where to concentrate testing in order to find failures.

    \item When time is limited, which tests to run first, and in what order.

    \item What the ideal test suite size is.
    
    \item How to check that a fault has actually been repaired, and has not
    introduced further faults. 
    
    \item Whether a fault can be automatically repaired.

    \item ... 

\end{itemize}    

The list goes on! We are not there with providing solid answers to these
interesting research topics yet. If they interest you, maybe you'd like to
consider doing a PhD in this area!
