### 1. Analysis of the Method Under Test

__Comments:__ Complete automated analysis using Soot. 

__Mark:__ 70

---

### 2. Test Requirement Generation

__Comments:__ Only branch coverage, at the bytecode level. The problem with
bytecode is that is does not map to the source code so easily, making it harder
for a tester to know whether they have fulfilled software standards or not. 

__Mark:__ 50

### 3. Instrumentation

__Comments:__ Instrumentation done at the bytecode level. But, it is automated. 

__Mark:__ 70

---

### 4. Test Data Generation

__Comments:__ Own evolutionary algorithm implemented. Well done!

__Mark:__ 100

---

### 5. Coverage Level Computation and Reporting

__Comments:__ Coverage level reported, but for simple branch coverage at the
bytecode level. 

__Mark:__ 50

---

### 6. Test Suite Output

__Comments:__ Just outputs test cases to the console, no JUnit files produced.

__Mark:__ 60

---

### 7. GitHub Repo and README.md

__Comments:__ Great README file, I was able to run your tool with no problems. 

__Mark:__ 100

### Summary

A good attempt at the assignment. The choice to operate at the bytecode level
may have simplified many implementation decisions, but leaves you unable to
easily handle more complex coverage criteria. 

__Overall Mark:__ 85.0% (Number of people in team: 1 -> method used: average of top 4 grades.) Please note this is a raw mark, that is, any lateness penalties have not been applied (if applicable).
