### 5. Coverage Level Computation and Reporting

__Comments:__ Very basic branch coverage.

__Mark:__ 50

### 6. Test Suite Output

__Comments:__ JUnit test suites outputted, with expected outputs equal to
current functionality of the method under test. 

__Mark:__ 70

### 7. GitHub Repo and README.md

__Comments:__ The README.md is nicely detailed with information about how to
apply the API and automated aspects of the tool. However, there were few
automated steps involved to document. I could one find one example (BMI) to run
your tool with.

### Summary

A very minimalist approach to the assignment. I'd have liked to have seen you
stretch yourself a bit more - even if there was not time to do automated
parsing, you could have investigated implementing different coverage criteria on
top of your API.
