### 1. Analysis of the Method Under Test

__Comments:__ Manual but with a well-documented API.

__Mark:__ 50

### 2. Test Requirement Generation

__Comments:__ Branch coverage. 

__Mark:__ 50

### 3. Instrumentation

__Comments:__ This is manual, again, but with a well-documented API.

__Mark:__ 50

### 4. Test Data Generation

__Comments:__ Random for variables of basic type.

__Mark:__ 40

### 5. Coverage Level Computation and Reporting

__Comments:__ Very basic branch coverage.

__Mark:__ 50

### 6. Test Suite Output

__Comments:__ JUnit test suites outputted, with expected outputs equal to 
current functionality of the method under test. However there was only
one example (BMI).

__Mark:__ 70

### 7. GitHub Repo and README.md

__Comments:__ The README.md is nicely detailed with information about 
how to apply the API and automated aspects of the tool. However, there were few automated steps involved to document. 

__Mark:__ 65

### Summary

A very minimalist approach to the assignment. I'd have liked to have seen you stretch yourself a bit more - even if there was not time to do automated parsing, you could have investigated implementing different coverage criteria on top of your API.
