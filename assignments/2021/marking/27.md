### 7. GitHub Repo and README.md

__Comments:__ The README.md accurately reports the operation of the tool, how to
run it, and its limitations. However, a lot of the steps are manual and these
aren't very well documented. If I were to test an example not already provided,
it would not be clear to me what to do.

### Summary

A good effort. There is a bit of a lack of automation, which isn't balanced by
good user documentation on how to use your tool.
