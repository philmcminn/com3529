### 7. GitHub Repo and README.md

__Comments:__ I would have like to see a list of commands that I could follow to
run your tool - a lot of the onus is on the user to figure out what to do. While
the README.md provides a good overview of what you tool does, it's not a good
guide in terms of how to use it.
