### 2. Test Requirement Generation

__Comments:__ MCDC is the coverage criterion.

__Mark:__ 65

### 3. Instrumentation

__Comments:__ There's no logging of coverage elements, so your approach is one more akin to static analysis. The problem with the approach you've taken is when inputs are not directly used in conditions. I'm not sure you quite understood this part.
