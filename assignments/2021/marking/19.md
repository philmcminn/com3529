### 3. Instrumentation

__Comments:__ There's no logging of coverage elements, so your approach is one
more akin to static analysis. The problem with the approach you've taken is when
inputs are not directly used in conditions. I'm not sure you quite understood
this part.

that you looked to incorporate open source libraries to achieve some of the
goals of the assignment.
