### 7. GitHub Repo and README.md

__Comments:__ I had to faff about to include the AVMf jar in your project with Maven (you could have just included this in your repository). Why did you put some of your tool code in the tests directory of Maven? This is reserved for actual tests, not test generating code. The README.md is not clear as to how to run your tool.
